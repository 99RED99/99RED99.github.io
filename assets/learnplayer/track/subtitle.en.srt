1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:05,533
This painting by Paul Cezanne is called
“Still Life withApples and Fruit Bowl”

2
00:00:05,533 --> 00:00:07,933
Take a look at the apples
in the painting.

3
00:00:07,933 --> 00:00:10,700
Cezanne drew apples
that are near the viewer larger

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,733
and the apples
that were far away smaller.

5
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:18,866
He used perspective to let the viewers have
a sense of distance from the flat picture.

6
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:25,233
Shall we attach the pictures of apples
to a background of Cezanne’s painting

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:30,500
and complete a “Still Life with Apples
and Fruit Bowl” that provides perspective?

8
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:40,033
Prepare a background picture of
“Still Life with Apples and Fruit Bowl”

9
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:45,166
photos of apples,
scissors, and glue.

10
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:53,800
First, cut out apples
from photos or magazines.

11
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,666
Big apples,

12
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,466
small apples,

13
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,633
round apples,

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,466
and distorted apples.

15
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:16,866
The more diverse the sizes
and shapes of the apples, the better.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,900
Now, place the apples you have cut out
on the dishes and the table of the picture.

17
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:31,100
So that you can have a sense of distance,
place the big apples in front,

18
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,666
and the small apples at the back,
just like Cezanne’s.

19
00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:37,566
Place big apples in front!

20
00:01:37,566 --> 00:01:40,733
Place small apples at the back!

21
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:44,166
Like Cezanne-place big apples in front!
Small apples at the back!

22
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:47,266
Create a sense of distance
using perspective.

23
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:51,033
Have you placed the photos of apples
on where you wanted to put them?

24
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:55,733
Attach the photos to the picture.

25
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,966
Well done!
